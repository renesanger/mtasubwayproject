There were many frustrations that i experienced during this project
problems i faced:
implementing a hash table
-the linked list has a posobbility of indexing to null
- should be an array instead of a vector because of fixed size
-prime number increaces efficiency

using the command.o and comman.h
i was not able to fix it and ended up creating my own parsing implementation of a file of commands 
the problem looked similar to the following:

undefined reference to `std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >::~basic_string()' command.cpp:(.text+0x126e): undefined reference to `std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >::~basic_string()

many seg faulting refering to either null and then trying to use a member function of a stations class
and also referencing a part of a vector that does not exist.

another interesting problem was the union function that i used to implement disjoint sets and unify them.
